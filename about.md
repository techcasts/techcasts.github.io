  Holy sh*t, why is Chrome taking so long to sync bookmarks? 
</p>

### Wait, what?
One day I was setting up a new laptop and running Chrome sync to grab all my stored bookmarks and it took [FOREVAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3b8LswWO1A). Okay, in my world 'forevah' meant about 5 minutes which seemed like an eternity for what is nothing more than a json file. To that end I decided to start actually tackling some of the projects that I had been bookmarking. To help keep myself on track I decided to do one project from a bookmark every weekday, track it on Github and post my experiences here. 

### And you are?
